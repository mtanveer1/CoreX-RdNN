### 🧪 Demo and Configuration

A demonstration of the proposed **CoreX-RdNN framework** can be executed using the provided scripts on benchmark datasets.

Demo parameter settings used:

```
C = 1e-5        # Regularization parameter
N = 103         # Number of enhancement nodes
activation = 6  # Activation function index
lambda_ = 0.01  # Regularization control 
gamma_ = 0      # Structural parameter 
thd = -1        # Correlation threshold
```
